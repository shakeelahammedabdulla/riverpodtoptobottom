## Project Overview

The project utilizes the `hooks_riverpod` package to manage state and provide data to the UI using streams. Specifically, it uses the `StreamProvider` to create and manage a continuous stream of names, which are displayed in a list on the home page.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you need to have Flutter installed. If you haven't installed it, follow the official [Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `flutter pub get` to fetch the project's dependencies.
4. Connect a physical device or start an emulator.
5. Run `flutter run` to start the application.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `lib/main.dart`: This is the main entry point of the application. It sets up the `App` widget, which is wrapped in a `ProviderScope` to manage the state using `hooks_riverpod`.
- `lib/app.dart`: Contains the `App` widget, which configures the app's theme and sets the home page as `HomePage`.
- `lib/home_page.dart`: Implements the `HomePage` widget, which is the main UI of the application. It uses the `ConsumerWidget` to watch the `namesProvider` and display the data accordingly.

## Usage

1. The `tickerProvider` is a `StreamProvider` that generates a stream of increasing numbers every second.
2. The `namesProvider` is another `StreamProvider` that uses the value from the `tickerProvider` to determine how many names should be displayed. It uses the `getRange` method to retrieve a subset of names from the `names` list.
3. The `HomePage` widget listens to the `namesProvider` using `ref.watch` and displays the list of names.
4. Depending on the state of the stream, the UI can be in three states: `data` (displaying names), `error` (when the list reaches its end), and `loading` (when the stream is initializing).
